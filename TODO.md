I already have a makeshift translation workflow using Python and shell scripts. I'd like to make a more cohesive piece of software to help me translate my blog posts as conveniently as possible. 

It should include the following functionality:

- Split the input text into sentences
- Display a text-based interface for the user that feeds them one sentence to translate at a time
- Show the previous few and next few sentences for context
- Query public APIs for suggested translations, word definitions, synonyms etc.
- Reassemble translated sentences into a document with the same format as the original
